# Exordium

This repository includes all the tools you need to start your own industrial grade projects. This repository includes:
- Golang (Back End)
- ReactTS (Front End)
- RabbitMQ (Message Broker)
- Redis (Cache)
- PostgreSQL (Database)

The front end uses `yarn` insteam of the regular `npm` for further dependability. Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) first.

Unlike [GDRP](https://github.com/acailuv/GDRP), this repository will only provide minimum demo and tutorial since an advanced level knowledge of full-stack web application development is expected from the user of this repository. this demo will only act as a boilerplate code for further development.
